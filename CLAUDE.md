# ListenBrainz Fresh Releases — LMS Plugin

## Project Overview
A plugin for Lyrion Music Server (LMS) that browses ListenBrainz Fresh Releases. It provides a personalised "For You" feed and a global "All Releases" feed. Filtering is controlled via settings, and the browse menu stays intentionally simple. The current build targets LMS v9.x and has been tested with Material Skin.

## Server Details
- **LMS Server**: 192.168.1.234:9000
- **OS**: DietPi (Debian Bookworm)
- **Service**: `lyrionmusicserver`
- **Plugin location (manual install)**: `/var/lib/squeezeboxserver/Plugins/ListenBrainzFreshReleases/`
- **Plugin location (repo install)**: `/var/lib/squeezeboxserver/cache/InstalledPlugins/Plugins/ListenBrainzFreshReleases/`
- **Log**: `/var/log/squeezeboxserver/server.log`
- **Material Skin**: `/var/lib/squeezeboxserver/cache/InstalledPlugins/Plugins/MaterialSkin/` (moved from manual to repo install)

## Current Version
0.6.11

## Settings Structure (v0.3.2)

Three sections in the settings page:

### General Settings
- `username` — ListenBrainz username
- `token` — ListenBrainz API token
- `lastfm_api_key` — optional Last.fm API key; enables the detail-page genre fallback when MusicBrainz has none (default empty = disabled)
- `days` — days window (1-90, default 14)
- `sort` — default sort (release_date / artist_credit_name / release_name / confidence)
- `group_by_artist` — collapse multi-release artists into one tappable entry (default ON)
- `week_dividers` — when sorted by release date, insert a divider per week; takes precedence over group_by_artist for the date sort (default ON)
- `play_via` — show inline playable streaming matches on the detail page (default ON)

### For You Settings
- `foryou_past` — include past releases (default ON)
- `foryou_future` — include upcoming releases (default OFF)
- `foryou_artwork_only` — hide releases without artwork (default ON)
- `foryou_various` — include Various Artists releases (default ON)
- Type checkboxes (`foryou_type_<name>`) — same set as All Releases; default ON: Album, Compilation. Default OFF: everything else. (Replaced the old single `foryou_albums` toggle in 0.6.11.)

### All Releases Settings
- `all_past` — include past releases (default ON)
- `all_future` — include upcoming releases (default OFF)
- `all_artwork_only` — hide releases without artwork (default ON)
- `all_various` — include Various Artists releases (default ON)
- Type checkboxes — default ON: Album, Compilation. Default OFF: Single, EP, Broadcast, Other, Soundtrack, Live, Remix, Demo (Soundtrack dropped from defaults in 0.6.11)
- All types stored as `all_type_<name>` prefs

## Browse Menu (v0.3.2)

```
ListenBrainz Fresh Releases
├── For You (requires username + token)  ← filtered by For You prefs
└── All Releases                          ← filtered by All Releases prefs
```

No in-menu filter sub-menus. All filtering driven entirely by settings prefs.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Plugin Base Class
- Uses `Slim::Plugin::OPMLBased` — correct base for browsable content plugins
- `is_app => 1` puts it in the **Apps** section of Material Skin
- `menu => 'radios'` required by OPMLBased even when is_app is set

### Settings Registration
- Uses `Slim::Web::HTTP::CSRF->protectName()` and `->protectURI()` — required for settings to appear in Material Skin's settings menu
- `Settings->new()` called inside `if (main::WEBUI)` **before** `$class->SUPER::initPlugin()`
- `Browse` and `API` modules explicitly `require`d in `initPlugin` before `SUPER::initPlugin`
- Settings template uses LMS TT2 format: `[% PROCESS settings/header.html %]`, `[% WRAPPER setting %]`, `[% PROCESS settings/footer.html %]`
- Prefs accessed in template as `[% prefs.username %]` (not `pref_username`) — the base handler populates these automatically

### install.xml Format
- Uses `<extension>` (singular) root element — matches manually installed plugins like NowPlayingShare
- `<extensions>` (plural) format is for repo-installed plugins — DO NOT use for manual plugins
- `<optionsURL>` points to `plugins/ListenBrainzFreshReleases/settings.html`
- `<homepageURL>` points to the GitHub repo so a "more info" link shows in Manage Plugins (NOT `<link>` — that's ignored; Qobuz/Bandcamp use `homepageURL`)
- `<icon>` points to `ListenBrainzFreshReleasesIcon_svg.png` — the Material `_svg.png` convention. **OPMLBased uses `_pluginDataFor('icon')` (i.e. install.xml) for the app icon and ignores any `icon =>` arg** (confirmed in `OPMLBased.pm` lines 62/185), so this single ref serves the Material app/menu tile, Material's Manage Plugins, AND non-Material skins. Material sees the `_svg.png` name, loads the sibling `.svg`, and recolours it per theme (white on dark, black on light). Non-Material skins show the real transparent PNG fallback.

### Icon System (Material Skin) — authoritative rules from Material's developer
- `_svg.png` suffix → Material loads the matching `.svg` and recolours it. (Other naming: `*_MTL_icon_<name>.png` uses a Material **font** icon; `*_MTL_svg_<name>.png` uses a Material **bundled** SVG.)
- **CRITICAL: the SVG must use `#000` (3-digit), NOT `#000000`.** Material does a literal string replace of `#000` with the theme colour; `#000000` becomes `<colour>000` (invalid) → the icon renders **blank**. This was the real cause of the long-running "blank/black icon" bug, fixed in 0.6.11 (18 `#000000` → `#000`).
- SVG size should be 24×24px with ≥2px border (set `width="24" height="24"`; viewBox `0 0 48 48` with content inset gives the border). Optimise with `scour` if available (not installed locally).
- Three icon files: `…Icon.svg` (source, all `#000`), `…Icon_svg.png` (install.xml ref + non-Material fallback), `…Icon.png` (generic fallback). The two PNGs must be **real transparent PNGs** — earlier they were JPEGs misnamed `.png` (opaque black blocks), which is why Manage Plugins went black. Regenerated via `qlmanage` → Pillow (luminance→alpha, centre, 8% pad).

### Image Proxy Caching
- Registered via `Slim::Web::ImageProxy->registerHandler` matching `coverartarchive\.org`
- Only active when LMS server pref `useLocalImageproxy` is enabled
- LMS caches CAA images locally, avoids repeated external fetches

### API
- Personalised feed: `GET /1/user/<username>/fresh_releases` (requires token)
- Global feed: `GET /1/explore/fresh-releases/`
- Response structure: `payload.releases` (NOT `payload.fresh_releases`)
- Cover art: `https://coverartarchive.org/release/<caa_release_mbid>/front-250`
  - Requires `caa_release_mbid` (the authoritative "has art" signal); returns undef when absent. Do NOT fall back to `release_mbid` — it's always present, which 404s for art-less releases and defeats the artwork-only filter (fixed in 0.4.4)
- Token validation: `GET /1/validate-token?token=<t>`
- No hard cap is applied to the API payload; filtering runs on the full result set so artwork and type filters can behave correctly
- Release detail enrichment (two MusicBrainz lookups, in parallel, both cached):
  - Tracklist: `GET …/release/<mbid>?inc=recordings&fmt=json` (`getReleaseDetails`)
  - Genres: `GET …/release-group/<release_group_mbid>?inc=genres&fmt=json` (`getReleaseGroupGenres`) — genres live on the **release-group**, not the release; release-level genres are nearly always empty (this was a bug fixed in 0.6.11). Cached by release-group MBID so releases sharing a group reuse it
  - Fetched on-demand when a release is opened (so the anonymous MusicBrainz 1 req/sec limit is generally fine; two near-simultaneous calls degrade gracefully if one is throttled)
  - Requires a descriptive `User-Agent` (set in `API::USER_AGENT`) or MusicBrainz returns 403
  - `API::getReleaseDetails` returns `{ genres => [names], media => [{ position, format, tracks => [{position,title,length}] }] }`
  - Detail page degrades gracefully to base metadata if the lookup fails

### Display / New Music Tracker–inspired presentation
- Release detail page shows base metadata, then genres and a per-disc tracklist (m:ss durations) pulled from MusicBrainz
- `group_by_artist` (default ON): artists with one new release stay inline; artists with several collapse into an `Artist  (N)` entry that expands to their releases
- Pagination: handled natively by LMS/Material — `_buildItems` returns the whole filtered+sorted list as one level and the client windows/scrolls it (no manual paging; see 0.4.7). Keeps Material's in-list filter working across the full list
- Not ported from New Music Tracker (needs a web-app backend the OPML plugin doesn't have): OAuth login, artist following, wishlists, genre/style *filtering*, listener/popularity counts

### Release Type Filtering
- The API does NOT support release type as a query parameter
- Filtering is done client-side in Browse.pm after receiving results
- Matches against both `release_group_primary_type` and `release_group_secondary_types`
- MusicBrainz primary types: Album, Single, EP, Broadcast, Other
- MusicBrainz secondary types tracked: Compilation, Soundtrack, Spokenword, Interview, Audiobook, Audio drama, Live, Remix, Mixtape/Street, Demo
- For You section uses `foryou_albums` (boolean, albums-only when ON)
- All Releases section uses individual `all_type_<name>` checkboxes
- Browse item rendering now uses the actual API title/type fields so All Releases shows the real release title and type rather than falling back to a generic album label

### Various Artists Detection
Detected in `_isVariousArtists()`:
- Artist credit name matches "various artists" (case insensitive)
- OR `artist_mbids` contains the VA MBID `89ad4ac3-39f7-470e-963a-56509c546377`

### Prefs Namespace
`plugin.listenbrainzfreshreleases` — used consistently across all modules

## Known Issues / Notes
- Log level set to INFO in Plugin.pm and API.pm for debugging — can be changed to WARN for production
- `<extensions>` vs `<extension>` in install.xml matters — manually installed plugins must use `<extension>` singular
- File ownership must be `squeezeboxserver:nogroup` on DietPi — NOT `squeezeboxserver:squeezeboxserver`
- The zip must extract directly as `ListenBrainzFreshReleases/` with no extra `Plugins/` wrapper for manual installs
- Material Skin's grouped artist release page layout is NOT achievable from OPML feeds — only via native library `albums_loop` responses. Solved in earlier versions by using Browse by Type sub-menus, removed in v0.3.0 in favour of settings-driven filtering.

## Version History
- 0.0.x — Initial development, plugin loading fixes, API parsing fix
- 0.1.0 — PNG icon
- 0.1.1 — Lyrion-spec icons
- 0.1.2 — Image proxy caching, Browse by Type
- 0.1.3 — Full MusicBrainz type support, removed Release Type filter
- 0.1.4 — Past/Future toggles in top-level menu (later removed due to odd behaviour)
- 0.1.5 — Moved past/future to settings
- 0.1.6 — Icons restored on menu items, settings link added (later removed as broken)
- 0.1.7 — Material Skin release type icons for Browse by Type
- 0.1.8 — Removed broken settings link
- 0.1.9 — install.xml icon switched to .svg
- 0.2.0 — future default to 0, filter out releases without artwork
- 0.2.1 — install.xml icon reverted back to _svg.png
- **0.3.0** — Full restructure: three settings sections, simplified browse menu (no in-menu filters), per-section prefs (For You vs All Releases), Various Artists toggle, comprehensive type checkboxes with Album/Compilation/Soundtrack defaults
- **0.3.1** — Repository metadata and package version alignment; filtering now evaluates the full API response payload
- **0.3.2** — All Releases items now display the actual release title and release type from the ListenBrainz payload
- **0.3.3** — Both feeds paginate in pages of 50 via a "Next page (n/total)" link; the filtered list is captured in-closure so paging never re-hits the API, and the LMS back button returns to the previous page
- **0.4.0** — New Music Tracker–inspired presentation: release detail page now fetches genres + per-disc tracklist (durations) from MusicBrainz on demand (graceful fallback on failure); shows folksonomy tags carried in the fresh_releases payload (cleaned/deduped, no extra call); optional group-by-artist layout (default ON) collapsing multi-release artists; pagination generalised to window any item list. NB: a data probe found MusicBrainz/ListenBrainz genre coverage on fresh releases is ~8–9% (too sparse for genre *filtering* without Discogs), so only on-demand genre/tag *display* was added.
- **0.4.1** — "Find on streaming services" link on the detail page (`play_via` pref, default ON): lazily fans the "artist album" query out to installed streaming plugins via their registered `Slim::Menu::GlobalSearch` providers, so results are playable through each plugin's own protocol handler. Confirmed on the target server that both Qobuz (v3.7.0) and Bandcamp (v1.12.0) register GlobalSearch providers, so no per-service code is needed. `GlobalSearch->menu($client, {search=>...})` confirmed working by live test.
- **0.4.2** — Play-via now resolves to **direct playable albums** via each service's **own search API** (dropped the GlobalSearch approach — it only produced a search drill-down). Per-service adapters in `_findPlayable` / `_streamingAdapters`:
  - **Qobuz**: `Plugins::Qobuz::Plugin::getAPIHandler($client)->search($cb, lc($query), 'albums')`; results in `$res->{albums}{items}`; each title-matched album is rendered with the plugin's own `Plugins::Qobuz::Plugin::_albumItem($client, $album)` (a `type=>'playlist'` node → playable).
  - **Bandcamp**: `Plugins::Bandcamp::Search::search($client, $cb, {search=>$query})`; keep result items whose `passthrough->[0]{album_id}` is set (already-playable album nodes from `album_list`).
  - Adapter availability is detected with `Plugins::<Svc>::Plugin->can(...)` (safe when absent); the detail link is hidden when no supported service is installed. Async fan-out with a pending-counter barrier; title matching via `_titleMatch`/`_norm` (lowercase, strip bracketed qualifiers + punctuation), so it can occasionally miss/mismatch. Adding a new service = one more adapter sub + `_streamingAdapters` entry.
- **0.6.11** — **Icon fix (real root cause found).** Two defects, both fixed: (1) the `.svg` used `#000000`, but Material string-replaces `#000` with the theme colour, corrupting `#000000` → `<colour>000` (invalid) so Material rendered the icon **blank** — changed all 18 `#000000` → `#000` and set the canvas to 24×24 per Material's spec. (2) `…Icon.png` / `…Icon_svg.png` were **JPEGs misnamed `.png`** (opaque 256² black blocks), so non-Material/Manage-Plugins contexts showed a black square — regenerated as genuine transparent RGBA PNGs (centred, 8% pad) via qlmanage→Pillow. `install.xml <icon>` set to `…Icon_svg.png` (the standard two-file Material convention; abandoned the earlier colour-tile and white-SVG detours). Confirmed `OPMLBased` always takes the app icon from `install.xml <icon>` (`_pluginDataFor('icon')`, lines 62/185) and ignores any `icon =>` arg. **Genres bug fix.** Genres were fetched from the *release* (`release/<mbid>?inc=genres`), where they're almost always empty — verified against MusicBrainz: a release-group had 13 genres, its release had 1. Now genres come from the **release-group** via a new `API::getReleaseGroupGenres` (cached by release-group MBID); `getReleaseDetails` drops `+genres` and just returns the tracklist. `_releaseDetail` runs genres (RG) and tracklist (release) as separate parallel tasks (so a detail open can do 2 MB calls, both cached). Genre parsing refactored into `API::_parseGenres`. **But MB genres are empty for most fresh releases** (too new to be tagged — verified a today's-feed release-group returned `[]`), so this rarely shows anything. The practical genre source is the payload's inline `release_tags` (no API call). 0.6.11 now shows up to 3 of these tags on each **list** row's `line2` (via `_releaseTags` in `_buildReleaseItem`, separated by `\x{00B7}`), in addition to the existing detail-page "Tags:" line. Coverage is partial (~20% of releases carry tags), so many rows legitimately show none. **Last.fm genre fallback (detail page):** new optional `lastfm_api_key` pref. When set, the detail page runs `API::getLastfmTags($artist,$album)` in parallel — tries `album.gettoptags`, falls back to `artist.gettoptags` (artist tags are populated even when a brand-new album isn't, so this is what actually fills the gap). `_releaseDetail` now stores `$mbGenres`/`$lfmGenres` and builds ONE "Genres:" line in `$finish`, preferring MB then Last.fm. Tags cleaned/weight-sorted via `_parseLastfmTags` (handles Last.fm's single-tag-as-hash quirk), cached `lbf:lfm:<artist>|<album>` (30d found / 7d empty). No key = graceful no-op; never blocks the page (all Last.fm failures resolve to empty). List rows are deliberately NOT enriched (would be 50+ API calls/page). **Unified section filtering:** For You used to have only a single "Show Albums" toggle (`foryou_albums`); it now has the **same per-type checkboxes** as All Releases (independent `foryou_type_<name>` prefs). Both sections' type/various/artwork filters now go through one shared `_filterSection($releases,$prefix)` + `_allowedTypes`/`_typeMatches` (replacing the duplicated `_filterForYou`/`_filterAll` bodies; both are now thin wrappers). **Default selected types are now Album + Compilation for both sections** — Soundtrack was dropped from the defaults (`all_type_soundtrack` 1→0). NOTE: default changes only affect prefs that were never persisted; an existing install still has `all_type_soundtrack=1` saved, so that box must be unticked once manually (For You is new prefs, so it picks up the new defaults immediately). **Secondary-type filtering bug fixed:** the API field is `release_group_secondary_type` (SINGULAR, a scalar string e.g. `'Live'`) — the code was reading `release_group_secondary_types` (plural/array), so secondary types were never seen and live/soundtrack albums (which are `primary=Album` + `secondary=Live/Soundtrack`) slipped through. Verified against the API: only two type fields exist, both singular scalar strings, never arrays. New `_secondaryType($rel)` helper reads the singular field (array-tolerant for safety) and is used by `_typeMatches`, `_displayType`, list `line2`, and the detail page. `_typeMatches` now uses **allowlist** semantics: primary type must be ticked AND the secondary type (if present) must also be ticked. The API's secondary set is larger than the offered checkboxes (DJ-mix, Audiobook, Interview, Spokenword, Mixtape/Street, Field recording, Audio drama) so any untickable secondary correctly fails the filter. Simulated on the live feed with Album+Compilation: 19,709→6,413 kept, all primary=Album, secondaries only None+Compilation, zero Live/Soundtrack. `_displayType` now shows `primary / secondary` (e.g. "Album / Live"); the redundant separate `PLUGIN_LBF_SEC_TYPES` detail line was removed. **Week dividers as real Material headers:** Material advertises `features:hi` in its browse requests ('h' = it supports the `header` item type, which renders bold/accent and enables grid view). XMLBrowser passes the item `type` straight through (`Slim::Control::XMLBrowser` line ~1050: `$hash{type} = $item->{type}`), and Material's `browse-resp.js` sets `item.header=true` for `type=='header'`. When the client supports it, week-divider rows are emitted as `type => 'header'` instead of `type => 'text'`; non-supporting skins still get plain text. **Gotcha (cost a debug cycle):** `features` is a request param only available to the TOP feed (XMLBrowser builds the coderef sub-feed's `$args->{params}` from `$feed->{query}`, line 491 — NOT the request params — so `fetchForYou`/`fetchAll` never see it). Fix: `topLevel` reads `features` via `_featuresOf($args)` and forwards it through each menu item's `passthrough` (which XMLBrowser DOES pass to the coderef, line 521); `fetchForYou`/`fetchAll` read `$passDict->{features}` and call `_wantHeaders()`. Diagnosed via JSON-RPC: `listenbrainzfreshreleases items 0 N item_id:1 features:hi` returned `type:'text'` for dividers (proving the broken detection); after the passthrough fix it returns `type:'header'`. **Header "More" gotcha (0.6.11):** in menu mode XMLBrowser forces a `go` (drill) action onto EVERY non-`text` item — only `type:'text'` gets `itemNoAction` (line ~1174), and `$item->{style}` only sets `$windowStyle`, while the `jive` override runs too late and gets stripped (line ~1372). So a `header` item always carries `actions.go`, and Material renders a "More" link for any header with actions (`item.slimbrowse && item.header && item.actions`) — which drilled to `item_id:X` returning `count:0` ("reveals nothing"). There is NO way to keep `type:'header'` AND suppress the action. Resolution (user choice): instead of fighting it, `_buildWeekly` now gives each week header a `url` coderef (+`passthrough`) that returns just that week's releases (same pattern as `_buildGrouped`), so tapping a week header / its "More" shows that week rather than an empty page. `_buildWeekly` groups by week up-front to build the per-week coderef. Verified the full server response (with `menu:1 useContextMenu:1`) to confirm the forced `go`/`addAction`. **Home-page click-in dividers (0.6.11):** the Material home shelf is itself `LBFForYou items …` (our `homeForYou`, registered via `HomeExtraBase`). The carousel and the expanded "show all" view run the SAME command — only the requested quantity differs (`HomeExtraBase`/Material don't forward `ismore` to the feed): carousel = `NUM_HOME_ITEMS` (10), expand = `LMS_BATCH_SIZE` (25000). So `homeForYou` now reads `$args->{params}{_quantity}` and, when `>50` (the click-in), returns `_buildItems($releases,$client,1)` (week dividers/headers + per-week drill coderefs) instead of the flat capped card strip; the carousel path is unchanged. Headers are forced on (1) because `LBFForYou` is only ever invoked by Material. Material's `browse-resp.js` re-parses the click-in (`ismore`) results through the main `parseBrowseResp`, so `type:'header'` renders identically to the For You menu. **CRITICAL fix — feed caching (0.6.11):** the ListenBrainz feeds (`getFreshReleasesForUser`/`getFreshReleasesAll`) were NEVER cached, so every Material home-row load re-fired a slow (2–15s) API call. Diagnosed from the live server log (fetched over HTTP at `http://<lms>:9000/log.txt`): 9 `Fetching for-you releases` in ~3 min, **0 cache hits**, `Server closed connection` (ListenBrainz rate-limiting the flood), and `Slim::Web::JSONRPC::requestWrite Context not found` (response arrived after Material gave up) → home carousels never loaded / Material appeared hung. Fix: cache the parsed feed under `lbf:feed:user:<username|sort|past|future|days>` and `lbf:feed:all:<…|date>` for `FEED_TTL` (6h); first view fetches, the rest are instant, killing the flood. The menu browse and the home row share the same key (same prefs). Lazy refresh was chosen over a scheduled daily fetch (a "fresh" feed wants intra-day freshness; the plugin is global so there's no per-listener timezone; All Releases also auto-rolls at local midnight via the date in its key). **Settings dropdown fix:** the **Default sort order** was a native `<select>`, whose option popup drew over / bled through the rows below it in Material's settings view (native `<option>` popups can't be reliably restyled). Replaced with a radio-button group (same `pref_sort` name/values) — no popup, no overlap, consistent with the page's existing checkbox blocks. `settings.html` now has no `<select>` elements.
- **0.5.2** — Hardening from a code review: (1) **detail-page watchdog** — `_releaseDetail` sets a `Slim::Utils::Timers` timer (`DETAIL_TIMEOUT` 15s) that forces the merge/render if a streaming or MusicBrainz callback never fires (a hung/partial-failure search previously hung the whole page, including the already-fetched tracklist); `$finish` is idempotent so normal completion makes it a no-op. (2) **guarded cache write** — `$cache->set` in `_findPlayable` wrapped in eval so a Storable serialisation failure can't stop the `$callback` (another hang path). (3) **MBID validation** — the "View on MusicBrainz" `weblink` is only built for a well-formed UUID (it lands in a Material-rendered href).
- **0.5.1** — Better streaming match recall for awkward credits: (1) the service search query is now built from **normalised terms** (`$artistNorm $albumNorm`) so quotes/`&`/commas in multi-artist names don't make the search miss the album (e.g. `Lee "Scratch" Perry & Mouse on Mars`); (2) artist matching switched from bidirectional substring to **token-subset** (`_artistMatch`: every word of the shorter credit must appear in the longer), tolerating word order, `&` vs `,`, and partial credits — while title-contains-album still gates precision. (3) **Home-row icon fix:** the Material home extra now uses the recolourable `_svg.png` icon (as the browse menu does) instead of the install.xml colour tile, which rendered blank in the home row while other plugins showed theirs.
- **0.5.0** — **Material Skin home-page scrollable row** for the For You feed. New `HomeExtras.pm` subclasses `Plugins::MaterialSkin::HomeExtraBase` and registers a home "extra" (`tag => 'LBFForYou'`, `title => PLUGIN_LBF_FOR_YOU`, plugin icon); its feed → `Browse::homeForYou` returns a flat, 50-capped list of release cards (For You filters/sort, no weekly dividers/grouping — unsuited to a carousel). Registered in `Plugin::postinitPlugin`, gated on `MaterialSkin->can('registerHomeExtra')` (mirrors Qobuz/Bandcamp). Also **renamed "For You" → "New Releases for You"** (the `PLUGIN_LBF_FOR_YOU` string drives the browse menu item and the home row; the settings section header `PLUGIN_LBF_SECTION_FORYOU` was renamed to match). Pattern reference: Bandcamp `HomeExtras.pm`. Also added: **README.md** (GitHub docs — features, requirements/ListenBrainz account, defaults, home shelf), an install.xml **`<homepageURL>`** to the repo (shows as the "more info" link in Manage Plugins), and a colour **tile SVG** icon for install.xml so the Manage Plugins icon isn't blank (the existing icons are black silhouettes for Material's recolour and render blank in core Manage Plugins).
- **0.4.9** — The MusicBrainz line on the detail page is now a clickable `weblink` (**View on MusicBrainz**) that opens the release page in the browser, instead of plain text showing the URL. (Same `weblink` mechanism as the top-level Plugin Settings entry.)
- **0.4.8** — **Caching** so revisits don't re-search (uses `Slim::Utils::Cache`, persistent across restarts). Streaming matches keyed by `lbf:stream:<release_mbid>` (TTL 7 days found / 1 day no-match); MusicBrainz tracklist+genres keyed by `lbf:mb:<mbid>` (30 days found / 1 day empty). OPML item `url` coderefs can't be Storable-serialised, so streaming items are cached with `url` stripped + a `_svc` tag and the play coderef is **reattached on read** (`_rebuildStreamItems`: Qobuz→`QobuzGetTracks`, Bandcamp→`get_album`; items whose service is gone are dropped). Note: Qobuz's own API also caches ~5 min internally; this is our durable layer on top. **Barrier fix:** `_releaseDetail` now counts both async tasks (streaming + MB) up front — a cache hit fires its callback *synchronously*, so the old per-task `$pending++` let the barrier complete after the first finished and drop the other's data (symptom: tracklist missing on cached revisits).
- **0.4.7** — Replaced manual drill-in pagination with **native XMLBrowser windowing**: `_buildItems` (and the artist-group drill-in) now return the full filtered+sorted list as one level; LMS/Material window/scroll it. Removed `_paginate`, `PAGE_SIZE`, and the next/prev page strings. Reason: manual pages were separate menu nodes, so Material's in-list search/filter only saw the current page — a single level lets the filter span every item, and gives Material's native scroll + prev/next pager. (Settings filters — artwork/type/VA — were already global, applied in `_filter*` before building items.)
- **0.4.6** — UI polish: (1) fixed mojibake in the week divider — it used a **literal em-dash** in the Perl source (rendered as `â€"`); all non-ASCII must use `\x{}` escapes (as the rest of the file does), decorative dashes dropped; (2) list rows now show **year only** `(YYYY)` instead of the full release date (the week divider carries the date) — matches LMS album-year convention; (3) pagination gained a **Previous page** link (top of page 2+) alongside Next, both using arrow glyphs (`\x{25C0}`/`\x{25B6}`) instead of the plugin logo. NB: pagination is drill-in, so Previous pushes a new level rather than popping — the back button still works; revisit with native XMLBrowser windowing if the stacking becomes annoying.
- **0.4.5** — Streaming match disambiguation: `_albumMatches` (replaces `_titleMatch`) now requires the candidate **title to contain our album title AND the artist to match** (bidirectional substring to tolerate "feat."/credit variants). Fixes wrong-artist results like "Bending Light" pulling in unrelated same-titled albums. Artist is passed through `_findPlayable` → adapters as `$artistNorm`; falls back to title-only when our artist is empty.
- **0.4.4** — Fixes + view options: (1) **sort** is now applied client-side in `_sortReleases` — release date is **newest-first** (the API returned oldest-first), confidence highest-first, artist/album A–Z; (2) **weekly dividers** (`week_dividers`, default ON) add a "— Week of D Mon YYYY —" divider per week in the date-sorted view (`_buildWeekly`/`_weekStart`, Monday-based, via `Time::Local`), taking precedence over group-by-artist for the date sort; (3) top-level menu now has a **Plugin Settings** entry (`weblink` to settings.html) → For You / All Releases / Plugin Settings; (4) **artwork-only filter fix** — `coverArtUrl` now requires `caa_release_mbid` (it used to fall back to the always-present `release_mbid`, so the filter never excluded art-less releases and thumbnails 404'd).
- **0.4.3** — Streaming matches are now shown **inline on the detail page** (no "Find on streaming services" tap): `_releaseDetail` runs the streaming search and the MusicBrainz lookup in parallel and merges both into one callback (base meta → streaming matches → genres → tracklist). Each result uses the **service's own logo** as its thumbnail (`_pluginIcon` → `_pluginDataFor('icon')`) so the source is obvious; dropped the `"Svc:"` name prefix. Trade-off: the detail page now waits on the streaming search(es) before rendering, so it can be a touch slower (Bandcamp scraping is the slowest).
